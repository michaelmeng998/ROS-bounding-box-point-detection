Details involve:

-need to send a bunch of x y coordinates to subscriber, then
determine which points are inside the bounding box created.

-in order to create the box, need to first get 4 coordinates. easiest way to do is it generate random point, start from there,

	-add or subtract a random number from y coordinate to get top left

	- +/- from x to get the bottom right

	- +/- from x and yo get the diagonal point of the bounding box

-most likely create the bounidng box at the listener node
